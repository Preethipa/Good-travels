# Good-travels
Created with CodeSandbox.
Welcome to my profilio! I make this recommendation app by using JavaScript, HTML and CSS learned from neog.camp.
Do you love to trave many places? If yes, you would find some recommendation places for travel. 

The below text is to explain my project detials.

This app built with ReactJS by using Codesandbox.
First, select template for ReactJS.

In program,

Step-1: create object for place and rating.
Step-2: select genre by using useState() method.
Step-4: select place and rating by using map method
Step-5: Print an list.


It is same procedure for that made in emoji interpreter app but differ print as list.
